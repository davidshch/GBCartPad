# GBCartPad ðŸ‘¾
A 16-key Game Boy Cartridge Macropad with an OLED display and LEDs for each key and uses KMK firmware!

## Why'd I make it
I've always wanted to make a full-stack hardware project and design my own PCB, so this was my first introduction to that. I also love Nintendo and thought the Game Boy cartridge design would make a really nice case for something like a macropad. I'll probably use it for basic things, such as a numpad for my laptop and some shortcuts I use, but the important part for me is that it's built and working. It was a great learning experience overall, and it will definitely help me with future hardware projects I want to make.
